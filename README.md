'Trace The Path' Game:
- This is actually a sample kivy code from pydroid 3 app, I improvised it to make a simple tracing game.

Objective: 
- A predefined path or pattern appears on the screen. The player's goal is to trace this path as accurately and quickly as possible.

Gameplay:
- A pattern or path appears on the screen, which the player must trace.
- The player touches the starting point of the pattern and tries to trace it without lifting their finger.
- As the player traces, they earn points based on accuracy and speed.
- If the player deviates from the path, they lose points or face a penalty.
- Once the path is successfully traced, a new, more complex path appears, and the player progresses to the next level.

  Plans:
  - Might make a UI and add some gameplay to it and to track the points.
  - Add level if I have time.
  - Make it interactive if I feel it, will make it apk.
